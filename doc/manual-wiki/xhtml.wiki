Ocsigen provides several ways to generate and type xhtml pages.

* You can use the XHTML.M module, by Thorsten Ohl, that provides a
  typing based on OCaml's polymorphic variants (See
  [[wiki(66):TyXML]]).
* It is also possible to use a syntax extension to write your pages
  with the usual xhtml syntax. This solution is also typed with
  polymorphic variants ans is compatible with the previous one (See
  [[wiki(66):TyXML]]).
* You can also use eliom with OcamlDuce. To take benefit of it, use
  OCamlDuce instead of OCaml.
* You can also choose to generate untyped xhtml as text.

===Text XHTML

The last possibility is to use untyped xhtml. Just build strings
containing your pages. Have a look at <<a_manual chapter="basics"
fragment="p1baseprinciples"|one example>>.

===OCamlduce

OCaml's type system is not powerfull enough to type XML. OCamlduce
manual says: //"The goal of the OCamlDuce project is to extend the
OCaml language with features to make it easier to write safe and
efficient complex applications that need to deal with XML
documents. In particular, it relies on a notion of types and patterns
to guarantee statically that all the possible input documents are
correctly processed, and that only valid output documents are
produced."//
