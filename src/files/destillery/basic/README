This project is (initially) generated by eliom-destillery as the basic
project "%%%PROJECT_NAME%%%".

Here's a bit information on how to work with it:

 - Compile it
     $ make all (or byte/opt)

 - Run the server without installation
     $ make run.local

 - Install it (you may want to adjust the variables in the Makefile before)
     $ sudo make install

 - Run the server on the installation
     $ make run

%%%ifdef OCAML4%%%
 - All Eliom files (*.eliom, *.eliomi) in this directory are
   automatically considered.

   To add a .ml/.mli file to your project, add it to the variable
   SERVER_FILES or CLIENT_FILES.

%%%endif
%%%ifdef OCAML3%%%
 - To add a source file (.ml,.mli,.eliom,.eliomi) to your project, add
   it to the variable SERVER_FILES or CLIENT_FILES

%%%endif%%%
 - Re-compute the dependencies, necessary after changing the project's
   file in the Makefile
     $ make depend

 - If you need a findlib package, add it to the variables
   SERVER_PACKAGES and/or CLIENT_PACKAGES.

 - The directory static/ will be statically served. Put your CSS and
   additional JavaScript files here!
